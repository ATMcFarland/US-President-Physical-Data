# US-President-Physical-Data

Dataset contains height, weight, BMI, astrological sign, corrected IQ, and some additional data found from various sources. Enjoy!

Columns that need further explanation:
<order> Presidential order (Stephen Grover Cleveland has "22 & 24" in this field and therefore I combined some of his data points for consistency sake)

<name> Full president names (S in "Harry S Truman" does not stand for anything)

<corrected_iq> Source: Simonton, D. K. (2006). Presidential IQ, Openness, Intellectual Brilliance, and Leadership: Estimates and Correlations for 42 U.S. Chief Executives. Political Psychology, 27(4), 511â€“526. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00524.x

Additional Notes:

Stephen Grover Cleveland's term start date and age both reference his first presidency and the term end date and age reference his second presidency (therefore his first term end date/age and second term start date/age are not present in the dataset)
Corrected IQ's study was in 2006, so there is no corrected IQ data for Obama, Trump, or Biden
